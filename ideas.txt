- ISSUES: import command should preload chunks
- ISSUES: save console / command history BEFORE executing command
- BUG: transparency of slime block is broken

- general config file: render distance, num loader threads, reduce textures, basically allow customizing every constant, stall alarm timeout
- unexploration - erase all generated blocks from map files (leaving only modified ones), replace erased blocks using new gen_block function
- store block_id -> block_name mapping inside *.sc files to enable upgrade if block_ids change
- merge quads: Is it sufficient to only do one fixed order like XY, and not both?
- try RunLengthEncoding instead of LZ4 for chunks

Multiplayer:
- 3rd person view chase camera
- nicer player avatars + animated limbs

Server:
- move block simulation (and chunk generation) to server
- server sleep mode when no connections (accept thread can wake it up!)
- ping command to measure latency
- log on stderr if send buffer becomes full (and message gets dropped)

Survival mode:
- climbing with hands when next to a block / step (move into step and jump to climb instead)
- ladders! have extra keyboard key for grabbing (or use sneak).
- elevator!
- rock-climbing on vertical walls
- swimming and diving (jump not working, up/down directions not working)
- physical tiredness when running / jumping / digging / swimming

World sim:
- animated translation / rotation of blocks (render in-between steps), enables more physical interation and large moving structures (ships / trains)
- allow extra per-block state for active chunks (like falling/rotating blocks / falling water)

Rendering:
- nicer ambient lighting for water
- PERF: keep chunk meshes in GPU memory

Trees:
- sideways falling trees when cutting them (animated in-between rotation + breaking of tree when falling)
- growing trees! (game of life)
- cactus!
- rounder tree trunks + new blocks for branches + new blocks for roots + more realistic spruce trees
- BUG: some leaf blocks missing from trees
- blocks sticking to tree leaves (not affected by gravity)

Server:
- start server in a background thread of the same process, have client connect via TCP loopback
- with live server have script to auto-upgrade client to the same version (without requiring source code + compilation by user)
